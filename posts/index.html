      TL;DR For those of you in a hurry: I made a version of the classic Pong game using Go and WebAssembly. I then embedded that game on my website. Warning: it works only on desktop now (no handling of touch). Here is the game, enjoy:
  Why WebAssembly WebAssembly is a relatively new standard on web browsers. From the Wikipedia page:
 The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high-performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other environments as well.

HAX Before flying to Shenzhen, actually as soon as we got accepted into the program, I watched a documentary that had been released by Wired just a few months before. It was starring Bunnie Huang, a brilliant electronics engineer who, while still a grad student at MIT, became the first person to hack the Xbox firmware back in December 2001.

La French Tech I joined Moona around the time we were selected to take part in the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). My co-founder Coline had taken part in a French start-up contest organized by La French Tech, the French label / movement to promote technology start-ups in France and abroad.

      Why Moona Before joining the Moona adventure, I was working on another start-up project, and doing part-time work as a freelance software developer.
I met my co-founder and CEO of Moona, Coline, in 2016. While she was looking for a co-founder after working on the project for a few months already, we were hanging out in the same entrepreneurship circles in Paris and we finally met to start working together informally in November 2016.

      This is the first post I write in a while&hellip; I had started writing a personal blog around 3 years ago. I wrote a couple of articles at the end of 2016 in order to showcase some data analysis, visualization and code work I&rsquo;d done, then left it aside for quite a while as I was starting to work full-time on Moona and things were getting very busy. A lot of things have happened since then and I want to put some stories and thoughts into writing for whoever might find it interesting or helpful.
