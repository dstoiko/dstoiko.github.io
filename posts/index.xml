      <description>This is the second article from a series on the story of Moona. Check out the other ones here Moona: Start-up Story Series.
HAX Before flying to Shenzhen, actually as soon as we got accepted into the program, I watched a documentary that had been released by Wired just a few months before. It was starring Bunnie Huang, a brilliant electronics engineer who, while still a grad student at MIT, became the first person to hack the Xbox firmware back in December 2001.</description>

La French Tech I joined Moona around the time we were selected to take part in the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). My co-founder Coline had taken part in a French start-up contest organized by La French Tech, the French label / movement to promote technology start-ups in France and abroad.</description>

      <description>Why Moona Before joining the Moona adventure, I was working on another start-up project, and doing part-time work as a freelance software developer.
I met my co-founder and CEO of Moona, Coline, in 2016. While she was looking for a co-founder after working on the project for a few months already, we were hanging out in the same entrepreneurship circles in Paris and we finally met to start working together informally in November 2016.</description>

      <description>This is the first post I write in a while&amp;hellip; I had started writing a personal blog around 3 years ago. I wrote a couple of articles at the end of 2016 in order to showcase some data analysis, visualization and code work I&amp;rsquo;d done, then left it aside for quite a while as I was starting to work full-time on Moona and things were getting very busy. A lot of things have happened since then and I want to put some stories and thoughts into writing for whoever might find it interesting or helpful.</description>
