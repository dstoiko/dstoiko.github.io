      <description>This is the second article from a series on the story of Moona. Check out the other ones here Moona: Start-up Story Series.
HAX Before flying to Shenzhen, actually as soon as we got accepted into the program, I watched a documentary that had been released by Wired just a few months before. It was starring Bunnie Huang, a brilliant electronics engineer who, while still a grad student at MIT, became the first person to hack the Xbox firmware back in December 2001.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a series of posts about the story of Moona, the start-up company I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on since November 2016.
I will tell the story of our company, our challenges, our mission and how we got from an initial prototype to a shipped product, from the moment I joined, which was 6 months after the project creation, up until now, 3 years later.
This series will include 7 articles after this one, with a focus on product development and technical challenges specific to the hardware-software mix of our venture, but also on team creation and management:</description>

      <description>This is the first post I write in a while&amp;hellip; I had started writing a personal blog around 3 years ago. I wrote a couple of articles at the end of 2016 in order to showcase some data analysis, visualization and code work I&amp;rsquo;d done, then left it aside for quite a while as I was starting to work full-time on Moona and things were getting very busy. A lot of things have happened since then and I want to put some stories and thoughts into writing for whoever might find it interesting or helpful.</description>
