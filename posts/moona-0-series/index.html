<h1 id="why-moona">Why Moona</h1>

<p>Before joining the <a href="https://getmoona.com" target="_blank">Moona</a> adventure, I was working on another start-up project, and doing part-time work as a freelance software developer.</p>

<p>I met my co-founder and CEO of Moona, Coline, in 2016. While she was looking for a co-founder after working on the project for a few months already, we were hanging out in the same entrepreneurship circles in Paris and we finally met to start working together informally in November 2016. After a few days I knew I wanted to be part of the project, so I jumped on board!</p>

<p>As a person who has always been on the &ldquo;light&rdquo; end of sleep, with some periods of insomnia stretching up to several months throughout my twenties, I have been interested in sleep as a health issue for a while. I am conscious of the immediate harmful impacts of bad sleep because I&rsquo;ve experienced them myself. The thing is, there are so many angles to tackle sleep. The reasons for bad sleep can be physiological (pain, hormonal disruptions, etc.), pathological (sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, cancer&hellip;), psychological (stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, etc.), environmental (bedroom temperature, humidity, bedding materials, etc.) and any mix of those. I found the idea of choosing one concrete active solution around temperature really good, as it is understandable by everyone (everyone can picture themselves on a warm summer night, tossing and turning to find a cool spot, while some of us are constantly running hot every single night), and thus provides a good entry point into the sleep market.</p>

<h1 id="the-moona-story">The Moona story</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing a series of posts about the story of Moona. I will tell the story of our company, our challenges, our mission and how we got from an initial prototype to a shipped product, from the moment I joined, which was 6 months after the project creation, up until October 2019, almost 3 years later.</p>

<p>This series will include 5 articles after this one, with a focus on product development and technical challenges specific to the hardware-software mix of our venture, but also on team creation and management:</p>
