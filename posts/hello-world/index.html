<p>This is the first post I write in a while&hellip; I had started writing a personal blog around 3 years ago. I wrote a couple of articles at the end of 2016 in order to showcase some data analysis, visualization and code work I&rsquo;d done, then left it aside for quite a while as I was starting to work full-time on <a href="https://getmoona.com" target="_blank">Moona</a> and things were getting very busy. A lot of things have happened since then and I want to put some stories and thoughts into writing for whoever might find it interesting or helpful.</p>

<h1 id="making-a-blog">Making a blog</h1>

<p>I was considering putting my content up on Medium or another blogging platform, but I found it a bit too boring, as they try very hard to make articles a commodity and leave little space for content creators to be creative in my opinion. I wanted my blog to be customized to my needs, and extendable with a showcase of projects or pieces of code I&rsquo;m tinkering with.</p>

<p>I really loved the concept of <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, which is a free way to get an open-source static website or blog up and running quickly, and fully customizable. At that time, I built it using the ruby-powered <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> framework, which allowed for quick setup using themes for templating and simple markdown for text formatting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m now putting up a new blog using the same concept. This time around, I will mainly talk about start-up stories, product development, hardware and software engineering, sleep research and technology, and other random thoughts if time allows. I&rsquo;m using the go-powered <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a> blogging framework because why not. And I will add a comments section using <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank">Utterances</a>, an open-source comments widget built on <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a>.</p>
